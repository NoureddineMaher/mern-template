Features
Client Setup: Initializes a React application using create-react-app.
Server Setup: Creates essential server directories for controllers, models, routes, middlewares, and helpers.
Package Management: Automates the installation of dependencies for both the client and server.
Prerequisites
Node.js and npm (Node Package Manager) should be installed on your machine. You can download and install Node.js from nodejs.org.
Setup Instructions
1. Clone the Repository
bash
git clone <your-repository-url>
cd <your-repository-folder>
2. Run the Project Setup Script
This script will create the necessary folders and initialize both the client and server directories.

bash
chmod +x scripts/helpers/setup_project.sh
./scripts/helpers/setup_project.sh
3. Install Client Packages
Run the script to install the packages listed in clientPackages.txt for the React client.

bash
chmod +x scripts/helpers/setup_client.sh
./scripts/helpers/setup_client.sh
4. Install Server Packages
Run the script to install the packages listed in serverPackages.txt for the Express server.

bash
chmod +x scripts/helpers/setup_server.sh
./scripts/helpers/setup_server.sh
Usage
